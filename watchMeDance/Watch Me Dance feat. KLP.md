***  
Pick a star from the sky  
Put it in my pocket  
Keep it safe from the breeze  
Look around  
Look around  
Tell me have yout got it  
If you'd only agree  

Then you could  
Start watching me, watching me  
You could,  
Lift your eyes up to the sky  
You could,  
Start watching me watching me  
It's possible you could  

You could watch me dance, dance, dance, dance  
You could watch me dance, dance, dance, dance  
You could watch me dance, dance, dance, dance  
You could watch me dance, dance, dance, dance  

oh  

Hands up up two now  
Fingers wide open  
Breathing deep from inside  
Take a sip  
Take a dip  
Dive into my ocean  
Let my waves float around  

Where you could  
Start watching me, watching me  
You could,  
Lift your eyes up to the sky  
You could,  
Start watching me watching me  
It's possible you could, hey  

You could watch me dance, dance, dance, dance  
You could watch me dance, dance, dance, dance  
You could watch me dance, dance, dance, dance  
You could watch me dance, dance, dance, dance
