Got a ticket on a one way train  
Don't know where we're going  
But I wanna go with you  

It's alright if we take a little longer  
It's alright if we stop along the way  
As we make it to our destination  
oh huh  

Love strong  
Our love is stronger  
Hold on  
Hold a little longer  
We can make it out the other side  
Believe in me and together we'll rise like a  
Love strong  
Our love is stronger  
Hold on Hold a little longer   
We can make it out the other side  
Believe in me and together we'll rise  

Got a feeling as I look from my shoulder  
Don't know where it came from  
But I know it stars with you oh  
And its alright if you hurt a little baby  
Its alright if we fall a little out of the line uh huh  
Wo oh  

Love strong  
Our love is stronger  
Hold on  
Hold a little longer  
We can make it out the other side  
Believe in me and together we'll rise like a  
Love strong  
Our love is stronger  
Hold on  
Hold a little longer  
We can make it out the other side  
Believe in me and together we'll rise  

Can you hear it when I'm calling your name  
I'm hearing it echo down your windowpane  
Can you hear it when I'm calling your name  
I know where we're going every day  

Love strong  
Our love is stronger  
Hold on  
Hold a little longer  
We can make it out the other side  
Believe in me and together we'll rise like a  
Love strong  
Our love is stronger  
Hold on  
Hold a little longer  
We can make it out the other side  
Believe in me and together we'll rise  

Love strong  
Our love is stronger  
Hold on  
Hold a little longer  
We can make it out the other side  
Believe in me and together we'll rise like a  
Love strong  
Our love is stronger  
Hold on  
Hold a little longer  
We can make it out the other side  
Believe in me and together we'll rise
