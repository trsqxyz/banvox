I don't wear high heels  
I got timberlands  
I can wear short skirts  
Couse I got the legs  
I prefer t-shirts  
Loaded with gold chains  
(Those gold chains, oh)  
know my way around  
I don't need no-  
Body to tell me what to do  
know exactly  
What I want  
Baby you can try  
But u ain't ever gonna give it to me  

Pre-chorus:  

I got all you want  
Except for my  
I Got all you want  
Except for my  
I got all u want  
Except for my brain  
Brain, brain, brain, brain, brain  
It's been a longtime comin  
So baby don't be frontin'  
My heart you can't steal  
Coz guess what I'm the real deal  

Chorus:  

You only want me for I thing  
Keep dreaming on coz I'm more than  
Baby blonde with a cute smile  
I got the brains to turn you wild  
X2  

Verse 2  

You might b cool  
But I'd rather be real  
You say the right things  
To the right crowd  
But when you sit alone  
On Baby be real  
How do you feel?  
I write my own song
I bang my own drums
We've all got scars  
So take off your mask  
I'm not a saint and  
I know you're not a sinner  
But all I'm trying say  
Is I can buy my own dinner
